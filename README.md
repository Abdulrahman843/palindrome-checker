# Palindrome Checker

This project allows users to check if a word is a palindrome. The program takes user input, removes non-alphanumeric characters, and checks if the word reads the same forward and backward, ignoring case.

## Features

- Prompts the user to input a word.
- Removes any non-alphanumeric characters (such as punctuation or spaces).
- Checks if the cleaned word is a palindrome.
- Displays a message indicating whether the word is a palindrome.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the logic for checking if a word is a palindrome.
- **Git**: For version control and managing the project.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abdulrahman843/palindrome-project.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd palindrome-project
    ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser**:
    You can open the file by double-clicking it or using the following command depending on your operating system:
    - **Windows**: `start index.html`
    - **macOS**: `open index.html`
    - **Linux**: `xdg-open index.html`

4. **Enter a word**:
    When the page loads, you will be prompted to enter a word. The program will display whether or not the word is a palindrome.

## Example

### Input:
Enter a word: racecar
Enter a word: hello
### Output:
"racecar" is a palindrome.
"hello" is not a palindrome.
